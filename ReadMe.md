Here's an example README file for the Cookie Clicker automation script we discussed earlier:

# Cookie Clicker Automation

This is a Python script that automates the Cookie Clicker game using Selenium WebDriver.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to install Python and the Selenium WebDriver library. You'll also need to download the Chrome WebDriver and add it to your system's PATH. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install the Selenium library using pip:

```
$ pip install selenium
```

3. Download the Chrome WebDriver from the official website: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
4. Extract the downloaded file and add the `chromedriver` executable to your system's PATH.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it using the Python interpreter:

```
$ python cookie_clicker.py
```

The script will open the Cookie Clicker game in a Chrome window and start automating clicks and upgrades. The script runs for 5 minutes and then prints the number of points earned per second during the game.
